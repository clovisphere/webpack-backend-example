# Node+MySQL+Webpack

Sample that shows how to use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for backend app. This example uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) for illustartion purposes, but the logic is the same for any backend app.

I will assume you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

#### Clone Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/clovisphere/webpack-backend-example.git && cd webpack-backend-example
```

#### Build
```
npm run build
```

#### Run
```
make run
```

Enjoy :sunglasses: :v: :fire:
